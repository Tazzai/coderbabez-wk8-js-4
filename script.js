/*
  1. Write a function called getName that gets the current value of the name input field, and returns it.
*/



/*
  2. Create an event handler that calls getName when the button is clicked,
      stores the return value in a variable,
      and then appends "Hello {{name}}" to the body of the html page.
      NOTE: Don't forget to put your event handler inside a document ready function
*/




/*
  3. BONUS: create a second function called greeting,
  that takes a name parameter,
  and appends "Hello {{name}}" when called.
  Update your code above to use your new greeting function
