// All the code you will need to create for this project will be completed below

//1. UPDATE the divide, multiply, suqare_root, and logBase10 functions so they return the mathematically correct answer.
//Check your work by using those buttons on the calculator, and hitting "=".

function divide(x,y){

}

function multiply(x,y){

}

function square_root(x){

}

function logBase10(x){

}

// Hint: This should return a random number between 0 and 1
// We haven't taught you how to do this - you'll have to look it up
function generateRandomNumber()
{

}

//2. CREATE the "subtract", "add" and "power" functions on your own.
//They should each have two parameters, and should return the mathematically correct answer. Check your work on the calculator
// NOTE: Make sure the names of hte functions are EXACLTY "subtract", "add", and "power", or the calculator will not work.
